# Pytorch Generation Models
Generation models using Pytorch.

I'm going to add new generation models every day.

Starting with the basic models!


## VAE(Variational AutoEncoder)

Add description to..

## CVAE(Conditional Variational AutoEncoder)

Add description to..

## Next tasks

1. Should add convolution layers in CVAE.
Current CVAE based on DNN.
So, I should change CVAE to convolutional CVAE.

2. Need New generation models.
First, add GAN and DCGAN
