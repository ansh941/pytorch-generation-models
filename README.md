# Pytorch Generation Models
Generation models using Pytorch.<br>
I'm going to add new generation models every day.<br>
Starting with the basic models!
<br>

## Next tasks

1. Should add convolution layers in CVAE.<br>
Current CVAE based on DNN.<br>
So, I should change CVAE to convolutional CVAE.<br>

2. Need New generation models.<br>
First, add DCGAN<br>

3. Korean to English<br>
